 Subject: British Society for Parasitology 12th Malaria Meeting
 Location: University of Leeds, U.K.
 Dates: 10-12 September 2001
 Scientific sessions will cover a wide variety of topics encompassing
 vaccines and immunology, pregnancy and clinical malaria, structural
 genomics and drug targets, and meteorological satellite data predictions of
 malaria incidence.
 The local organisers are Judith Smith (j.e.smith@leeds.ac.ukfor further
 details), Glenn McConkey and Andrew Taylor-Robinson.
 Full programme and registration forms will be sent out to members in the
 February 2001 mailing and posted on the BSP website at that time
 <http://www.parasitology.org.ukor www.abdn.ac.uk/bsp>. Non-members are
 welcome to both contribute and attend.
 A satellite meeting of the EuroMalVac Consortium is planned for the
 preceding weekend (8-9/9/01) at a residential retreat in the Yorkshire
 dales, which is being organised by Mike Hollingdale (e-mailm.r.hollingdale@lshtm.ac.ukfor further details).
 Vaccinologists are encouraged to attend both meetings, while molecular
 biologists and biochemists should note that the Malaria Meeting has been
 planned so as not to clash in 2001 with the Woods Hole Molecular
 Parasitology meeting.
