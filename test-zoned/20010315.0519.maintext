 In the ongoing discussion related to the use of vaccines in the control and 
 eradication of FMD, one of the worldwide operating manufacturers of FMD 
 vaccines [Bayer] believes it to be responsible to make a clear statement.
 1. FMD vaccines are preparations of inactivated FMD virus of one or several 
 strains adjuvanted with an appropriate adjuvant e.g. Al(OH)3 (Aluminum 
 hydroxide), Saponin, Quil A or hydrocarbon systems. Vaccines are 
 manufactured according to the requirements of GMP (Good Manufacturing 
 Practice) and meet the requirements of  the [drug manufacturing 
 regulations] in the country of production.
 2. Before vaccines can be sold on the market they have to be registered in 
 the country of origin and/or the country of use. As with all vaccines, FMD 
 vaccines have to pass a batch release test following the directions of the 
 [appropriate regulations]. The most important tests in this regard are:
 -    Test for freedom [from] bacteria and fungi
 -    Safety test (test for residual live FMD virus)
 -    Efficacy test.
 Concerning safety, it must be confirmed the vaccine does not contain any 
 residual live FMD virus. This has to be done according to the European 
 Pharmacopeia (EP) in 3 different test systems:
 -    Inactivation kinetic, an in-process control, which proves there is not 
 one infectious virus particle in 10 000 liters of the sample
 -       3 blind passages of the inactivated virus in susceptible tissue
 culture
 -       target animal testing
 As the FMD virus is inactivated with a "first order kinetic inactivant," 
 e.g. BEI, there is a high [likelihood] the vaccine is safe and will not 
 cause outbreaks of FMD.
 With regard to efficacy, the vaccine has to pass a target animal potency
 test. The minimal efficacy expressed in "Protective Doses 50 percent"
 (PD50), and must be greater than 3. If the vaccine is intended for
 emergency use, a higher PD 50 may be required. The efficacy of greater than
 6 PD50 is considered appropriate for such cases. The testing for efficacy
 is done in the target animal, either in a challenge trial or, if a
 correlation has been shown between the challenge test result and a
 serological response after vaccination, in a quantitative serological test,
 e.g. antibody detection ELISA.
 3. FMD vaccines manufactured and tested in this way are a useful tool in 
 the control and eradication of FMD.
 This has been proven in many counties of the world, e.g.: Belgium, France, 
 Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain in Western Europe and Uruguay in Latin 
 America. It has been proven that even in cases of outbreaks in FMD-free 
 countries, emergency ring vaccination helps to regain FMD-free status, 
 provided all remaining control and eradication measures (the most important 
 of which are stamping out [the disease itself] and [enforcing] animal 
 movement restrictions) are performed in parallel with vaccination.
 4. Discussion of emergency vaccination frequently includes the demand for 
 further R&D to improve vaccines and to develop vaccines that allow for 
 distinction between vaccination antibodies and infection antibodies.
 The cost for such research and development is extremely high and the 
 probability of successfully marketing such a vaccine is quite low. As 
 evidence, it can be mentioned that animal health companies have developed 
 marker vaccines against classical swine fever with much effort. At the time 
 when such a marker vaccine is registered and ready to be marketed, the 
 demand is relatively low because of the current political and legislative 
 situation. This does not encourage pharmaceutical companies to risk 
 expensive R&D in further development of FMD Vaccines.
