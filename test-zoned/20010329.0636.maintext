 Vaccination? Not for the USA, but perhaps for Europe
 ----------------------------------------------------
 .
 [The] current policy of APHIS [US Department of Agriculture's Animal & 
 Plant Health Inspection Service] is that FMD vaccine will only be used in 
 the USA under 5 circumstances: if an outbreak has not been contained within 
 6 months, if it affects 25% of the livestock in a given area, if the 
 cost/benefit ratio of slaughter approaches 1:2, if the disease becomes 
 endemic in the wildlife of 3 or more states, or if slaughter is found to be 
 illegal.
 Of course, as is happening in Europe, the policy on vaccination could 
 change in the face of a crisis. But it will be a complete waste of time to 
 argue the pros and cons of vaccinating in the USA when the disease reaches 
 there -� the word "when" is used deliberately -- for the following reasons.
 The US stockpile contains 2.5 million doses of type O vaccine, the type 
 that is causing the current pandemic. But there are 8 million head of 
 cattle in Texas alone, not to mention sheep and pigs. Given the massive 
 daily movements of livestock in the USA, and the time needed to vaccinate 
 2.5 million head, it would just be a diversion of scarce resources to 
 attempt vaccination there.
 Even ring vaccination around outbreaks would be useless. The British 
 experience has shown that, by the time a new outbreak is detected, the 
 disease has already spread far beyond that locality. And vaccination of a 
 strip along the Mexican or Canadian border would not help. Cattle are no 
 longer herded from one country to another; one truck crosses those borders 
 every few seconds, and does not stop until it is far inside the USA.
 The kindest thing would be for the US to give its vaccine stock back to 
 Europe, where it came from, to help the crisis there, and concentrate on 
 other means of control when the pandemic arrives. Alternatively, the 
 vaccine could be given now to protect US breeding stock or rare breeds 
 there which are not going to enter the food chain.
