 Foreign Animal Disease Online Course
 In January 2002, the Humanitarian Resource Institute announced the 
 development of a Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Center, which provides 
 access to online educational resources for both medical and veterinary 
 professionals (1.16.2002: Agricultural Security: Veterinary and Scientific 
 Experts Outline Priority Issues). In an effort to enhance training for the 
 recognition of Foreign Animal Diseases for field veterinarians, we have 
 developed the Foreign Animal Disease Online Course.
 Materials include:
 1. Foreign Animal Diseases: The Gray Book Online
 2. International Animal Health Code: Classification Office International 
 des Epizooties
 3. Foreign Animal Disease Training Modules: Published on the web by the 
 Veterinary Services (VS) division of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).
 4. Foreign Animal Diseases Online Test: The Online Test encompasses 200 
 questions (True/False) related to the foreign animal disease topics covered 
 in The Gray Book. Upon completion and online submission of the test, 
 individuals with a passing grade of 75 per cent or above will receive a 
 certificate of completion by Humanitarian Resource Institute
