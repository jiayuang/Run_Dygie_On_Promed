 FMD: Byrne welcomes political agreement on improved Directive to control 
 outbreaks
 --------------------------------------------------
 The Council of Agriculture Ministers today achieved political agreement on 
 revised and improved legislation on EU measures to control outbreaks of 
 foot & mouth disease (FMD). FMD is not dangerous for human health, but 
 outbreaks of this highly contagious viral disease in livestock have an 
 exceptional economic and psycho-social impact on the rural and national 
 economy in the EU.
 The amended Directive details the measures to rapidly control and eradicate 
 the disease and outlines procedures on recovering the status "free of FMD 
 and infection without vaccination", which is of crucial importance for 
 trade. Control actions are supplemented with measures to ensure a high 
 level of preparedness against the disease. The Commission is given a key 
 role in managing an outbreak in partnership with the Member States.
 Welcoming the agreement and congratulating the Greek Presidency, David 
 Byrne, Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, said: "Outbreaks of 
 foot-and-mouth disease in individual Member States impact on the EU as a 
 whole, as we saw in 2001. The amended law aims to maintain or, in the event 
 of an outbreak, quickly regain the 'FMD-free' status that is of key 
 importance for trade in animals and animal products. Emergency vaccination 
 is moved to the forefront of control measures instead of being the last 
 resort. The agreement is a true reform."
 The new draft law has broad support from the European Parliament, the 
 European Committee of the Regions, and the European Economic and Social 
 Committee as reflecting the lessons learned from the 2001 outbreak.
 The details of the draft law range from the notification of a suspect case 
 through to the measures to be taken in relation to animals and their 
 products during an outbreak until disease- and infection-free status is 
 regained. It makes provisions for a high level of disease preparedness, 
 notably contingency planning and vaccine banks, and also covers the 
 possibility of infection in wildlife.
 Being a carefully considered reform rather than a revolution, there is no 
 departure from the ban on prophylactic vaccination introduced in 1992, but 
 the emphasis on various control measures is shifted by moving emergency 
 vaccination closer to the forefront of the control strategy.
 This approach is bolstered by modified international trade rules and 
 laboratory tests to distinguish vaccinated from infected herds, which 
 allows the use of vaccination in a much more flexible way, albeit always in 
 connection with rapid stamping out of infected or contaminated animals of 
 susceptible species.
 Prior to the confirmation of an outbreak, veterinary services will be 
 empowered to establish suspect restriction zones and to impose a temporary 
 movement ban on large parts of affected Member States.
 The draft law also provides for "regionalisation", limiting restrictions to 
 the particular regions of a Member State that are affected by an outbreak. 
 This is of particular importance where emergency vaccination has been 
 carried out. Vaccinated animals from herds which have been tested for 
 absence of infection may -- after regaining the FMD-free status -- move 
 within the Member State concerned but not be traded to other member States.
 Detailed rules are laid down for the marketing of products such as milk and 
 meat from animals from restricted areas or from vaccinated animals. These 
 products are not dangerous to humans, and restrictions on their circulation 
 are kept to the minimum required to prevent spread of possible virus, 
 primarily through appropriate treatment or specific production conditions.
 The draft Directive outlines the measures to be taken in order to prepare 
 for an outbreak. The main new elements are:
 * Provisions are made for diagnostic facilities, in particular a Community 
 Reference Laboratory, including a bank for diagnostic reagents, test kits, 
 etc.
 * Detailed provisions are laid down for the management of the European 
 antigen bank and for access to this bank by Member States and, where 
 required, third countries. Specific rules are laid down for the 
 confidential treatment of information on the quantities and strains of 
 antigens stored at the bank.
 Emphasis is put on preparation of contingency plans, including the 
 preparation for a "worst case" scenario. Contingency plans have to be 
 regularly updated in the light of the results of alert exercises
 [The Council of Agriculture Ministers' decision to allow emergency 
 vaccination is indeed a significant change in the prevailing "no 
 vaccination" policy of the EU. However, it is distant from the policy 
 prevailing until 1991 in several central EU member countries (e.g. Germany, 
 France, Italy, The Netherlands, and others), where annual mass vaccinations 
 of all cattle older than 4-5 months with a trivalent FMD vaccine were applied.
 The UK Food Standard Agency (FSA) has welcomed the EU's reform. In April 
 2001, at the height of the FMD epizootic in the UK, the FSA declared that 
 it was satisfied that eating meat, milk, or other produce from animals that 
 have been treated with authorised FMD vaccines would not have any 
 implications for food safety. Nor did the FSA consider that there would be 
 any need to label meat products derived from animals that have been 
 vaccinated with the FMD vaccine.
