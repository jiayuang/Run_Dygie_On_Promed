 Amendments to EU Plant Health Directive 2000/29 EC
 The Agriculture Council adopted on 2002-11-28 amendments to Directive 
 2000/29/EC, which deals with protective measures against the introduction 
 and spread of organisms harmful to plants or plant products in the European 
 Union. The overall aim of the EU plant health legislation is to ensure 
 protection against pests that affect plants or plant products.
 The benefits of the amended Directive include:
 - strengthening of import clearance procedures for plants and plant products
 - improved conditions for cooperation between customs authorities and 
 official phytosanitary bodies in Member States
 - better information for importers
 - establishment of a harmonized system of fees
 - adjustments of the EU Plant Health regime to the conditions of the 
 internal market, responding to risks resulting from increased trade.
 The amended Directive came into force on 2002-12-30, the day of its 
 publication in the Official Journal, and requires Member States to adopt 
 and publish the provisions necessary to comply with it before 1 Jan 2005.
 The Commission will now focus on preparing various implementing measures 
 such as cooperation between the official phytosanitary bodies in the Member 
 States and the Customs authorities, model forms of documents to be used in 
 that cooperation, and the means of transmission of these documents. Such 
 measures must be taken to maintain the identity of the consignments and to 
 safeguard against spread of pests during transport until completion of the 
 required phytosanitary and customs formalities.
