 Re Dr. Schaffner's comments on the difficulty of isolating shigellae 
 from foods, the following development might be of interest:
 Together with Prof. Wanpen Chaicumpa from the Department of 
 Immunology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 
 Bangkok, we have developed monoclonal antibody-based antigen test 
 kits for _Shigella spp._ groups A, B, C, and D.  A study on the 
 validation of those kits using rectal swabs of patients has been 
 published.  As the kits are detecting antigens, they could also be used 
 for rapid food screening, but we would need a collaboration partner 
 for such a validation.
 If you are interested, I will be glad to send you the publication and 
 would be most grateful if you could suggest possible partners. Any 
 collaboration could be directly with Prof. Wanpen and the University, 
 without private sector intermediaries. We would just sponsor the kits.
 [Disclaimer: ProMED has no financial interest in this test, & is not 
 endorsing it.  However, we believe that sensitive and specific assays to 
 detect enteric pathogens in foods will be very helpful in the evaluation 
 of potential food-borne pathogen transmission vehicles. - Mods.LL &
