 BRUSSELS -- Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been eradicated from the 
 15-nation European Union except for Britain, EU Health and Consumer 
 Protection Commissioner David Byrne said Friday.
 The EU commissioner said a new European food authority providing expertise 
 and monitoring new forms of danger from foodstuffs was expected to go 
 operational next year.
 The Brussels Commission would also carry out a reappraisal of the rules 
 concerning vaccination to prevent FMD. The disease had been "eradicated in 
 all the member-states except the United Kingdom," he said.
 The outbreak was largely under control at European level. "But a high level 
 of vigilance remains an imperative in all member-states," Byrne stressed.
 An appraisal-in-depth had been in progress since April on all aspects of EU 
 legislation concerning control and eradication of foot-and-mouth.
 A conference on the topic expected in the autumn would examine whether 
 vaccination ought to be used as a preventive measure.
 Asked whether consumer confidence had been shaken in the long term by the 
 FMD and BSE crises, Byrne said: "It's undeniable consumer confidence in the 
 ability of the food sector and the public authorities to guarantee a high 
 protection level has been shaken."
 The official said he would introduce new proposals this autumn to 
 strengthen and harmonize food controls in member-states. Byrne also noted 
 much remained to be done to help the public to get food risks in 
 proportion. These risks were far lower than those from tobacco, he said.
