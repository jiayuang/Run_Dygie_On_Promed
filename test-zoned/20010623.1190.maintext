 Vaccinia (Smallpox) Vaccine: Recommendations of the ACIP, 2001
 [excerpts]
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---
 These revised recommendations regarding vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine
 update the previous [US] Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
 (ACIP)  recommendations (MMWR 1991;40; No. RR-14:1-10) and include
 current information regarding the non-emergency use of vaccinia
 vaccine among laboratory and health-care workers occupationally
 exposed to vaccinia virus, recombinant vaccinia viruses, and other
 orthopoxviruses that can infect humans.
 In addition, this report contains ACIP's recommendations for the use
 of vaccinia vaccine if smallpox (variola) virus were used as an agent
 of biological terrorism or if a smallpox outbreak were to occur for
 another unforeseen reason.
 Variola virus is the etiological agent of smallpox. During the
 smallpox era, the only known reservoir for the virus was humans; no
 known animal or insect reservoirs or vectors existed. The most
 frequent mode of transmission was person-to-person, spread through
 direct deposit of infective droplets onto the nasal, oral, or
 pharyngeal mucosal membranes, or the alveoli of the lungs from close,
 face-to-face contact with an infectious person. Indirect spread (i.e.,
 not requiring face-to-face contact with an infectious person) through
 fine-particle aerosols or a fomite [object] containing the virus was
 less common.
 Vaccinia vaccine is a highly effective immunizing agent that enabled
 the global eradication of smallpox... As a result, recommendations for
 routine smallpox vaccination were rescinded in 1971. In 1976, the
 recommendation for routine smallpox vaccination of health-care workers
 was also discontinued. In 1982, the only active licensed producer of
 vaccinia vaccine in the United States discontinued production for
 general use, and in 1983, distribution to the civilian population was
 discontinued. All military personnel continued to be vaccinated, but
 that practice ceased in 1990. Since January 1982, smallpox vaccination
 has not been required for international travelers, and International
 Certificates of Vaccination forms no longer include a space to record
 smallpox vaccination.
 Currently, international concern is heightened regarding the potential
 use of smallpox (variola) virus as a bioterrorism agent. Because of
 these concerns, ACIP has developed recommendations for vaccinia
 (smallpox) vaccine regarding the potential use of smallpox virus as a
 biological weapon. Additionally, recommendations regarding vaccination
 of persons working with highly attenuated strains or recombinant
 vaccines derived from highly attenuated strains of vaccinia virus have
 been revised.
 VACCINIA VACCINE
 Dryvax,ï¿½ the vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine currently licensed in the
 United States, is a lyophilized, live-virus preparation of infectious
 vaccinia virus (Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., Marietta, Pennsylvania).
 ***** Vaccinia vaccine does not contain smallpox (variola) virus.
 *****
 Previously, the vaccine had been prepared from calf lymph with a seed
 virus derived from the New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH) strain
 of vaccinia virus and has a minimum concentration of 108 pock-forming
 units (PFU)/ml. Vaccine was administered by using the
 multiple-puncture technique with a bifurcated needle. A reformulated
 vaccine, produced by using cell-culture techniques, is now being
 developed.
 SMALLPOX VACCINE FOR BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS
 Although use of biological agents is an increasing threat, use of
 conventional weapons (e.g., explosives) is still considered more
 likely in terrorism scenarios. Moreover, use of smallpox virus as a
 biological weapon might be less likely than other biological agents
 because of its restricted availability; however, its use would have
 substantial public health consequences. Therefore, in support of
 current public health bioterrorism preparedness efforts, ACIP has
 developed the following recommendations if this unlikely event occurs.
 Surveillance
 A suspected case of smallpox is a public health emergency... A
 suspected smallpox case should be reported immediately by telephone to
 state or local health officials and advice obtained regarding
 isolation and laboratory specimen collection. State or local health
 officials should notify CDC immediately if a suspected case of
 smallpox is reported... [Countries should immediately notify the World
 Health Organization also. - Mod.JW]
 Because of ... healthcare-associated smallpox transmission from
 imported cases present in a hospital setting, health officials should
 be diligent regarding use of adequate isolation facilities and
 precautions.
 Currently, specific therapies with proven treatment effectiveness for
 clinical smallpox are unavailable. Medical care of more seriously ill
 smallpox patients would include supportive measures only...
 Pre-release Vaccination
 The risk for smallpox occurring as a result of a deliberate release by
 terrorists is considered low, and the population at risk for such an
 exposure cannot be determined. Therefore, pre-exposure vaccination is
 not recommended for any group other than laboratory or medical
 personnel working with non-highly attenuated Orthopoxviruses (see
 Routine Nonemergency Vaccine Use)...
 Post-release Vaccination
 If an intentional release of smallpox (variola) virus does occur,
 vaccinia vaccine will be recommended for certain directly exposed
 groups and other persons who have an increased likelihood of contact
 with infectious materials from a smallpox patient (e.g., personnel
 responsible for medical waste disposal, linen disposal or
 disinfection, and room disinfection in a facility where smallpox
 patients are present)...
  Persons who have received a previous vaccination (i.e., childhood
 vaccination or vaccination  more than 3 years before) against smallpox
 might demonstrate a more accelerated immune response after
 revaccination than those receiving a primary vaccination. If possible,
 these persons should be revaccinated and assigned to patient care
 activities in the early stages of a smallpox outbreak until additional
 personnel can be successfully vaccinated...
