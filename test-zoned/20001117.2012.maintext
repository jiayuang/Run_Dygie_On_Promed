 Rabies Vaccination Inquiry
 --------------------------
 .
 I would like to raise a question of importance in those countries where 
 attenuated rabies vaccine is used to control rabies in foxes. Every year we 
 have some inquiries concerning human contact with the bait through which 
 the live rabies vaccine is distributed. This vaccine is attenuated for 
 foxes, but there is, of course, no experience with humans.
 Therefore, we decided to recommend post-exposure treatment in cases 
 involving intensive contact.
 A related problem concerns the contact of vaccinated dogs with the same 
 bait. In these cases we have not recommended vaccination. [I believe Dr. 
 Slenczka is referring to post-exposure vaccination of the person having 
 been bitten by such a vaccinated dog. I do not believe he is referring to 
 the dog in this case. - Mod.TG] I would like to have other opinions on this 
 problem and would be happy to receive answers from some experts in the field.
