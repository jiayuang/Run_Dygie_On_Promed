 WASHINGTON: Could an obscure disease afflicting milk cows be making people 
 sick? Scientists are not sure, but the dairy industry wants the government 
 to eradicate the cattle illness. At least one in 5 herds [in the United 
 States] is believed to be infected with a livestock disease called Johne's 
 (pronounced YO-nees). Scientists are studying its possible link to Crohn's 
 disease, a chronic bowel disease in humans for which there is no known 
 cause or cure.
 The National Milk Producers Federation, which estimates Johne's [disease] 
 costs the dairy industry at least $200 million a year, is asking Congress 
 for $1.3 billion to identify and destroy infected cattle. "There's such a 
 tremendous public concern about the potential spread of disease from 
 livestock to humans. It's obviously something the dairy industry wants to 
 take seriously," said Franklyn Garry, a Johne's [disease] expert at 
 Colorado State University.
 "Even if this is, as we suspect, not a human health concern, it still is a 
 concern for cattle farmers," said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the milk 
 producers. Crohn's disease afflicts more than 500 000 people in the United 
 States, many under 30 [years of age], and causes such severe inflammation 
 that [some] patients [must] have sections of their intestines removed. Its 
 link with Johne's is hotly debated. The bacterium _Mycobacterium 
 paratuberculosis_, which causes Johne's [disease], is found in many -- but 
 not all -- patients with Crohn's disease. The diseases have similar 
 symptoms: diarrhea and weight loss.
 A popular theory about Crohn's is [that] it is triggered by the immune 
 system's reaction to a virus or bacterium. "Because of continued potential 
 public health concerns relating to this disease, animal production 
 industries must give this disease more attention," the United States 
 Department of Agriculture said in a 1999 report. The Crohn's disease 
 connection is a delicate one for dairy producers: they cannot afford to 
 ignore it, but they do not want to scare the public, said Garry.
 An Agriculture Department study in 1996 found 22 per cent of US herds had 
 at least 10 per cent of their cattle infected with Johne's disease. The 
 lower milk production resulting from the disease costs a 100-cow farm about 
 $18 000 a year. The milk federation wants the government to pay for testing 
 herds and to reimburse farmers for the loss of sick cattle. To avoid 
 affecting beef prices or raising public health concerns, infected animals 
 would be slaughtered and sent to rendering plants for non-food uses. About 
 334 000 cattle (about 3.6 per cent of the nation's milk cows) would be 
 destroyed under the 7-year program.
 [The link between _M. paratuberculosis_ and Crohn's disease is tenuous at 
 best. This concern is likely to result in policy changes that affect both 
 animals and people. - Mod.TG]
