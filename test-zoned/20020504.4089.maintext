 In the Riverina (about 100 km north of the Goulburn Valley) we see 
 most of our cases [of anthrax] in late summer/early autumn. The 
 Riverina is the south-central part of NSW on the Victorian border 
 between the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers and west of the Great 
 Dividing Range. It is the part of the world that I call home. The 
 Goulburn River runs into the Murray just on the Victorian side from 
 the Riverina. We are a little hotter and a bit drier than them, but 
 it is pretty close.
 Our weather was warm for the first half of April 2002 (about 30 deg 
 C) with a few light showers on 11-14th. This is what I would expect 
 before an anthrax incident. I don't think it would have been much 
 different at Tatura.
 [ProMED-mail does not customarily get into intense epidemiological 
 discussions, so this thread on the recent cases in Victoria and claim 
 of the latter's year-round incidence in contradistinction to NSW must 
 be cut (reluctantly). However, I am still puzzled, as anthrax in 
 grazing animals is normally seasonal. - Mod.MHJ]
