 ProMED-mail was highlighted at the International Conference on Emerging
 Infectious Diseases, Atlanta, GA, USA which ended on Wed 19 Jul 2000.
 Charlie Calisher & Jack Woodall hosted an overflow breakfast session on
 Monday morning, "Behind the Scenes on ProMED-mail," which introduced
 Managing Editor Dan Shapiro, Associate Managing Editor Ed Schroder &
 Medical Epidemiology & 
 Surveillance Moderator Marjorie Pollack, who were also present. The
 informal session ran through a brief history of ProMED-mail & answered
 questions.
 Jack Woodall later presented a poster entitled "The Future of Outbreak
 Reporting is on the Internet," featuring ProMED-mail, & flyers explaining
 how to sign up for ProMED-mail were distributed.
 Marjorie Pollack presented a late breaker talk, co-authored by Martin
 Hugh-Jones, on a "Multinational Outbreak of Unexplained Deaths in Heroin
 Addicts Identified Through an Internet Based Early Warning System," which
 showed how a report from the 
 Norwegian Broadcasting Service, about anthrax in a drug user, posted on
 ProMED-mail sparked an international search for cases of unusual disease in
 heroin users, & uncovered an outbreak of _Clostridium novyi_ infections
 among them in the UK.
