 If you learn ONLY ONE THING from this document:  for assistance or 
 help, DO NOT send e-mail to the ProMED-mail posting addresses,promed@promed.isid.harvard.org'  ORpromed@promedmail.org.
 E-mail sent to these addresses is read by the scientific moderators.  
 They work very hard to ensure that you receive top-quality content 
 that is both accurate and informative. They do not administer the 
 operation of the conference.
   
 Be sure to address any technical problems or questions toowner-promed@promedmail.orgIf you forget this address, it is repeated at the bottom of each 
 ProMED-mail message.
 1.  HOW TO SUBSCRIBE
 Send an e-mail message tomajordomo@promedmail.orgType in the body of the message:
 	subscribe promedend
 You will then receive all posts, as they are generated.
 OR type
 	subscribe promed-digestend
 You will then receive a consolidated mailing of all posts, approximately 
 daily.  OR type

 2. HELP!  MY ATTEMPTS TO UNSUBSCRIBE ARE NOT WORKING.  WHAT SHOULD I DO?
   
 First, verify which ProMED-mail conference(s) you are subscribed to.  
 Many subscribers are unaware that ProMED-mail is actually a collection of 
 separate mailing lists, or conferences.  When you've determined the 
 conference(s) you are subscribed to, send a message to:majordomo@promedmail.organd type in the body of the message:
 	unsubscribe promedOR
 	unsubscribe promed-digestOR
 	unsubscribe promed-aheadOR
 	etc., as applicable.
 Do not include multiple unsubscribe commands on one line.
   
 3. HOW CAN I LEARN WHICH CONFERENCES I AM SUBSCRIBED TO?
   
 Send a message tomajordomo@promedmail.orgIn the body of the message, type:  
 	which  
 If you still require assistance, please send e-mail explaining the problem to:owner-promed@promedmail.org4. WHY DO THE SUBJECT TAGS DIFFER FROM THE CONFERENCES I AM SUBSCRIBED TO?
   
 Each ProMED-mail posting you receive contains in the Subject line a `tag' 
 or series of letters: `PRO' optionally followed by `/' and more letters.  
 The tag helps the Moderators to keep track of which conferences they have 
 chosen to send the post to.  The tags DO NOT indicate the conference(s) to 
 which you are subscribed.
   
 Remember that posts sent to the `promed-plant', `promed-edr', and 
 `promed-ahead' conferences are also carried in the main `promed' conference.
 In   addition, the Moderators may decide to post a message to multiple 
 conferences; for example, to AHEAD and EDR conferences.  Here are some 
 examples of  tags you might see on the various conferences:
   
 	promed         :   PRO>, PRO/ALL>, PRO/PL>, PRO/PL/EDR>, 
                            PRO/AH/EDR>, PRO/EDR>, PRO/AH, PRO/AH/PL>
 	promed-ahead   :   PRO/AH>, PRO/AH/EDR>, PRO/AH/PL>, 
                            PRO/ALL>
 	promed-edr     :   PRO/EDR>, PRO/ALL>, PRO/AH/EDR>, 
                            PRO/PL/EDR>
 	promed-plant   :   PRO/PL>, PRO/PL/EDR>, PRO/AH/PL>, 
 			   PRO/ALL>
 	promed-port    :   PRO/POR>
   
 5. HOW DO I OBTAIN A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROMED-MAIL CONFERENCES?
   
 Send a message tomajordomo@promedmail.organd in the body of the message, type: 
 	info promed
 You will receive a message describing all of the ProMED-mail  
 conferences.
   
 Remember:  there is no single conference called `promed-mail'.  
 The term `ProMED-mail' refers to the entire collection of conferences.
   
 6. HOW CAN I SEE ONLY HUMAN-SPECIFIC POSTS, NOT ANIMAL- OR PLANT-RELATED ONES?
   
 It is not possible.  The conference moderators have designed ProMED-mail to
 work this way.  Consider that the next plant or animal epidemic may have 
 direct consequences on the human population and you will see why this is a 
 wise decision.
   
 7. I KEEP GETTING MESSAGES SAYING I AM ON THE `BOUNCES' LIST.  WHAT IS THIS?
   
 If your account or site rejects e-mail from a ProMED-mail conference, we 
 remove your address from the conference lists and place it on an 
 administrative list called `bounces'.  Otherwise, for the approximately 
 twenty sent messages we average each day, we might receive thousands of 
 additional return messages!
   
 At regular intervals a message is automatically sent to all `bounces'
 subscribers explaining why they are receiving the message and what actions
 they can take to be removed from the `bounces' list and put back on the 
 ProMED-mail conference.   (We ignore return error messages from the 
 `bounces' list.)
 If you're unsure of the address to which you were subscribed prior to 
 being `bounced', follow the instructions in QUESTION 3: HOW CAN I LEARN 
 WHICH CONFERENCES I AM SUBSCRIBED TO?
 If you do not understand the instructions, forward the e-mail toowner-promed@promedmail.orgrequesting assistance.
   
 8. I AM GOING ON HOLIDAY.  CAN I TEMPORARILY SUSPEND MY SUBSCRIPTION?
   
 No, the conference software does not include a `vacation' feature. Send an
 e-mail message to unsubscribe from the conference(s) in question, and 
 resubscribe on your return.  Some mailer programs will allow you to set up 
 automatic filters to store your ProMED-mail messages in a special area 
 during your absence.   Please be careful about generating auto-reply or 
 `vacation' messages to the conference.  If we receive these messages,
 we may remove you from the conference and add you to `bounces' at our
 discretion.  We do not wish to receive auto-reply or `vacation' messages
 for each post we send, until you get back!
   
 9. I SEE REFERENCES TO ARCHIVE FILES AND LONG NUMBERS.  WHAT ARE THEY?
   
 ProMED-mail Moderators often refer to past postings that have been 
 archived.  It is helpful to retrieve these archived posts to gain additional 
 insight into the current situation.  
 For example: "[see also: Potato late blight:  global threat, 19970217230023]"  
 This refers to the archive file named "19970217230023." To fetch this archive 
 file by e-mail, send a message tomajordomo@promedmail.organd in the body of the message, type:
 	get promed 19970217230023
 Also, some extra-long archived files have alphabetical instead of numeric 
 filenames.  In those cases, the command is, for example,
 	get promed cyclospora
   
 You may include multiple `get' commands in the message; be sure that they 
 are on separate lines.
 10. HOW CAN I SEARCH AND OBTAIN SPECIFIC ARCHIVE FILES?
   
 ProMED-mail posts and archives are freely available to all.  However,
 the use of posts or archived material for commercial purposes requires
 permission and payment of a fee.  Requests should be sent topromed@promedmail.orgPlease credit ProMED-mail as the source of information or quotations
 used in publications.
 Although ProMED-mail makes every effort to provide accurate information,
 we cannot guarantee the accuracy of every posted item.
 There are three ways in which you can search for and obtain archived posts: 
 First, sophisticated searches are possible at the ProMED-mail website:http://www.promedmail.orgIf you do not wish to use the Web, you can search by e-mail in two ways:
 a)  You can use the `get' command to retrieve the TOPICS or  CONTENTS files.  
 TOPICS contains an alphabetical listing of the "Subject" lines of the posts, 
 along with the number of the archived file. 
 CONTENTS is similar, but it is sorted by chronological order.  
 To retrieve a TOPICS file for a particular year, send a message tomajordomo@promedmail.organd in the body of the message, type:
 	get promed TOPICS-19xx     
 where "xx" is the last two digits of the year desired.  
   
 You will receive a message that looks like this:
 <...>
 Anthrax, cattle - Canada (Alberta)                     19990724201301
 Anthrax, cattle - Canada (Alberta) (02)                19990803185756

 Anthrax, cattle - Canada (Alberta) (07)                19991005110926
 If you want to read about Anthrax in Canada (Alberta), send another
 message tomajordomo@promedmail.orgIn the body of the message, type:
 get promed 19990724201301
 get promed 19990803185756
 get promed 19990806230300

 You will receive individual e-mail messages containing one archived post
 each.
   
 11. HOW DO I KNOW WHICH CONFERENCE TO SEND A POSTING TO?
