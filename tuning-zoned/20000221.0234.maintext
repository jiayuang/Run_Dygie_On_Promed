 Viruses closely related to Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were  recently found
 in stored stool samples from 2 calves (United Kingdom and Germany) and 4
 pigs (Japan), sparking discussions about the potential for zoonotic
 transmission. To investigate if NLVs are commonly present in farm animals,
 pooled stool samples from 100 pig farms, 48 chicken farms, 43 dairy cow
 herds, and 75 veal calf farms from the Netherlands were assayed by reverse
 transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification, using primers
 specific for the detection of NLVs from humans. NLV RNA was detected in 33
 (44%) of the specimens from veal calf farms and two (2 percent) specimens
 from pig farms. Our data show  NLV infections - until recently thought to
 be restricted to humans - occur often in calves and sometimes in pigs.
 While zoonotic transmission has not been proven, these findings suggest
 calves and pigs may be reservoir hosts of NLVs.
